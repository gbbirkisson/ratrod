  Call rust in your varnish vcl configuration
</p>

Do not use this ğŸ™ˆ This is purely for just playing around. I wanted to see if I could do stuff
with rust in my `vcl`, and now I can.

The name `ratrod` comes from hot rod cars that have a "rusty" look.

This has been tested with `varnishd` version `6.0.13` on ubuntu. Works on my machine ğŸ˜‚

## Usage ğŸ“–

Make is your friend ğŸ˜‰

```bash
$ make run
```
